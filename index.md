# About Me

I’m currently a Master student in Automotive Engineering advised by Associate Prof. [Zhaoxia Peng](http://transportation.buaa.edu.cn/info/1092/4827.htm), at School of Transportation Science and Engineering, Beihang University. My research interests include **Multi-agent System, Multi-robot Formation Control, Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning**.

# Research Experiences

- **Multi-consensus based Formation Tracking and Splitting**
  - Prescribed Time Convergence, Multi-consensus, Switching Topology, Formation Splitting and Merging.
  
  - Solve constrained optimal problem by linear integer programming to add and delete the edges in the communication topology.
- **Nussbaum Functions based Formation Control with Unknown Control Directions**

  - Proposed a novel lemma of Nussbaum-type functions to overcome the limitation of the identical unknown control directions assumptions and control shock.
  
  - Designed a distributed control algorithm for the consensus problem, in which the input shock can be reduced by 80% with arbitrary UCDs.
  
  - Designed a distributed formation control algorithm for Multiple WMRs with unknown actuator nonlinearities and UCDs.
 
- **Observer-based Distributed Sliding Mode Formation Tracking Control**
  - Designed a distributed observer to estimate the state of the leader robot with limited communication range.
  
  - Developed a novel sliding surface and reference velocity with combined errors to improve the system’s robustness.
  
  - Designed a distributed control law for a group of nonholonomic mobile robots with the Euler-Lagrange system.

- **Minor Research**
  - Switching topology, Cooperative-Comepetitive topology, Cluster Consensus, and Signed Weighted Networks.
  
  - Complex Networks, Opinion Dynamics, Social Power, and Spectual Theory in Brain Networks.

- **Aging Mechanism of Lithium-Ion Batteries for HEV**
  - The attenuation of the maximum capacity of lithium-ion batteries with the number of cyclic charge-discharge was tested under different working conditions. Recorded data and analyzed the correlation with statistical methods.
  
  - The capacity attenuation model of the lithium-ion battery was established based on the pseudo-two-dimensions electrochemical model and used for the state of health (SOH) prediction.
