# About Me

I’m currently a research assistant advised by Associate Prof. [Junge Zhang](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~ZHANGJUNGE) in the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA). Before that, I got my Master Degree in Automotive Engineering, advised by Associate Prof. [Zhaoxia Peng](http://transportation.buaa.edu.cn/info/1092/4827.htm), at School of Transportation Science and Engineering, Beihang University.

My research interests include **Multi-agent System, Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning**, Multi-robot Cooperation Control.

# Research Experiences


- **Differential Privacy Protected Fully Decentralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for networked systems**

  - Introduce the Laplace noise-based Differential Privacy technique into the QD-Learning to protect the Q-table which may be associated with agent's privacy information.  
  - Prove the mean square convergence and expectation convergence of DP-QD-Learning. Provide the theoretical boundary of the variance of the convergence value.
  - Evaluate the DP-QD-Learning on the finite state-action tabular environment, which is capable to represent many social systems such as the center bank monetory policy influence.
  - Prove the \epsilon-differential privacy degree for the DP-QD-Leanring. (In progress)

- **Multi-consensus based Formation Tracking and Splitting**

  - Prescribed Time Convergence, Multi-consensus, Switching Topology, Formation Splitting and Merging.  
  - Solve constrained optimal problem by linear integer programming to add and delete the edges in the communication topology.
  
- **Nussbaum Functions based Formation Control with Unknown Control Directions**

  - Proposed a novel lemma of Nussbaum-type functions to overcome the limitation of the identical unknown control directions assumptions and control shock.  
  - Designed a distributed control algorithm for the consensus problem, in which the input shock can be reduced by 80% with arbitrary UCDs.  
  - Designed a distributed formation control algorithm for Multiple WMRs with unknown actuator nonlinearities and UCDs.
 
- **Observer-based Distributed Sliding Mode Formation Tracking Control**

  - Designed a distributed observer to estimate the state of the leader robot with limited communication range.  
  - Developed a novel sliding surface and reference velocity with combined errors to improve the system’s robustness.  
  - Designed a distributed control law for a group of nonholonomic mobile robots with the Euler-Lagrange system.

- **Minor Research**

  - Decentralized Training Decentralized Excution (DTDE) MARL, open ad-hoc in networked MARL.
  - Switching topology, Cooperative-Comepetitive topology, Cluster Consensus, and Signed Weighted Networks.  
  - Complex Networks, Opinion Dynamics, Social Power, and Spectual Theory in Brain Networks.

- **Aging Mechanism of Lithium-Ion Batteries for HEV**

  - The attenuation of the maximum capacity of lithium-ion batteries with the number of cyclic charge-discharge was tested under different working conditions. Recorded data and analyzed the correlation with statistical methods.  
  - The capacity attenuation model of the lithium-ion battery was established based on the pseudo-two-dimensions electrochemical model and used for the state of health (SOH) prediction.
