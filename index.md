# About Me

I’m currently a Master student in Automotive Engineering advised by Associate Prof. [Zhaoxia Peng](http://transportation.buaa.edu.cn/info/1092/4827.htm), at School of Transportation Science and Engineering, Beihang University. My research interests include **MAS, MRS, formation control, MARL, and Distributed Networked System**.

# Research Experiences

- **Multi-consensus based Formation Tracking and Splitting**
  - Design a prescribed-time convergence based distributed formation control law to enable the robots to realize the formation pattern in a flexible time T. Divide the whole communication topology graph into several sub-graphs which represent the sub-teams of the formation to perform different tasks after T.
  - Solve constrained optimal problem by linear integer programming to add and delete the edges in the communication topology to satisfy the EEP condition of multi-consensus.
- **Nussbaum Functions based Formation Control with Unknown Control Directions**

  - Proposed a novel lemma of Nussbaum-type functions to overcome the limitation of the identical unknown control directions assumptions and control shock.
  - Designed a distributed control algorithm for the consensus problem of multi-agent system by leveraging the novel Nussbaum functions. The simulation results show that the input shock can be reduced by 80% with arbitrary UCDs.
  - Designed a distributed formation control algorithm for Multiple WMRs with unknown actuator nonlinearities and UCDs.
 
- **Observer-based Distributed Sliding Mode Formation Tracking Control**
  - Designed a distributed observer to estimate the state of the leader robot with limited communication range.
  - Developed a novel sliding surface and reference velocity with combined errors to improve the system’s robustness.
  - Designed a distributed control law for a group of nonholonomic mobile robots with the Euler-Lagrange system.

- **Minor Research**
  - Switching topology in MAS. They expanded the traditional static topology into a time-varying graph that more matched the actual circumstances of the robot team.
  - Signed networks and cooperative-competitive graph with unknown relationship. Use the Nussbaum function to adaptively approximate the sign of the weights on the edge.
  - Complex networks and opinion dynamics, which illustrates the evolution and consensus of individual opinions under the evaluation and interaction of the group.

- **Aging Mechanism of Lithium-Ion Batteries for HEV**
  - The attenuation of the maximum capacity of lithium-ion batteries with the number of cyclic charge-discharge was tested under different working conditions. Recorded data and analyzed the correlation with statistical methods.
  - The capacity attenuation model of the lithium-ion battery was established based on the pseudo-two-dimensions electrochemical model and used for the state of health (SOH) prediction.
